TODO:

--- Phase 3 ----
- add the "dot" operator to the grammar and build an AST node for it
- add the "new" operator to the grammar and build an AST node for it 
- add a TSObject class and add a field to TSObject which is a HashMap for storing properties
- add a TSPropertyReference class, derived from TSReference. The "base" of a property regerence is an object.
- implement a TreeEvaluate method for the "dot" operator, which should produce a TSPropertyReference.
- Implement a TreeEvaluate method for the "new" operator, which should produce a TSObject.
- you will need to upgrade the earyly error detection for assignment to allow a "dot" operator to be the left child of assignment. See the "produceReference" method in ThreeBuilder.java 



-implement TSProperyReference
	-- getValue 
	-- putValue 


-added buildNewExpression


11.2.1 Properties are access by name; 
	MemberExpression . IdentifierName
	CallExpression . IdentifierName


DONE:

- added NEW to grammar
- added DOT to grammar 
- added buildPropertyAccessor() to MemberExpression grammar 
- added PropertyAccessor visit method to TreeVisitor
- added PorpertyAccessor visit method to TreeVisitorBase

- Changed TSPrimitive to extend from TSObject

NEXT:
evauluate the property accessor 
TreeDump



TSPrimitive extend TSObject ? 




Need to add call() method to TSFunctionObject 

in TreeDump, nested property accessors are not being build correctly
